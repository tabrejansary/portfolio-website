# Modal Display Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
The project modal was displaying with a white/blank background, making content invisible.

## Changes Made

### 1. **App.css** - Added Modal Styling
Added comprehensive CSS styling for the project modal including:
- Dark background (`#1a1a1a`) to match the portfolio theme
- White text color for all modal content
- Styled borders with subtle transparency
- Custom styling for:
  - Modal header and footer
  - Close button (inverted for visibility)
  - Project description text
  - Tech stack badges
  - Feature lists
  - Section lists
  - GitHub and Vercel link buttons with hover effects
  - "Coming soon" text styling

### 2. **ProjectCard.js** - Enhanced Icon Display
- Added inline styles to ensure icons display properly next to button text
- Added `flex-wrap` to project links container for better responsive behavior
- Improved spacing for "coming soon" messages

## What Now Works

✅ **Modal Background**: Dark theme matching the portfolio
✅ **Text Visibility**: All text is now visible in white/gray colors
✅ **Tech Stack Badges**: Properly styled with Bootstrap primary color
✅ **Feature Lists**: Clean, readable list with proper spacing
✅ **Section Lists**: Bold section names with descriptions
✅ **Buttons**: 
   - GitHub button with purple theme (`#AA367C`)
   - Vercel button with blue theme (`#4A2FBD`)
   - Hover effects for both buttons
✅ **Icons**: Lucide icons properly aligned with button text
✅ **Close Button**: White X button visible on dark background
